An Extremely Concise Praise of the Twenty-One Tārās
attributed to Atiśa

om jetsün pakma drolma la chaktsal lo
Oṃ. I submit obeisance to Tārā—she who is both exalted and revered.
chaktsal drolma taré pamo
I prostrate to Tārā the courageous saviouress,
tuttara yi jik kün selma
Who dispels all fear with Tuttāra
turé dön nam tamché ter ma
And grants all with Ture.
soha yiger ché la rab dü
With Svāhā, I offer my final homage.

When the incomparable Lord Atiśa was staying in Nyethang, he suddenly became quite ill. He supplicated
Tārā and requested her intervention. The noble goddess appeared before him and
told him that to cure his sickness he must recite the Praise to the Twenty-one Forms of Tārā
at least ten-thousand times in a single day. Atiśa replied that it would be impossible
for him to do so and asked if there weren't another way. Tārā replied by granting him this
extremely concise praise; coming from Tārā herself, this praise is said to be highly blessed.
