Prayer to Ārya Tārā
by Atiśa Dīpaṃkara

om, jikpa gyé kyobma la chaktsal lo
Oṃ! Homage to you, lady who protects us from the eight fears!
tashi palbarma la chaktsal lo
Homage to you, lady who blazes with the splendour of auspiciousness!
ngensong go gekma la chaktsal lo
Homage to you, lady who closes the door to lower rebirth!
tori lam drenma la chaktsal lo
Homage to you, lady who leads us on the path to higher realms!
taktu khyé kyi dongdrok dzé
You are the one who holds us always in your care—our guide, support and friend;
dadung tukjé kyab tu sol
So protect us still, we pray, with all of your vast compassion!

It is well known that while the Precious Lord Atiśa was travelling across the great ocean to
meet his teacher Serlingpa, when on one occasion the ship was in danger of sinking, he spoke
these words of prayer. As a result, Tārā appeared to him directly and saved them all from
peril.
